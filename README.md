## 2. Technical Requirements

### Software:
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `tkinter` or `PyQt5` (UI), `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy` (DB), `pandas`, `matplotlib` (data-related modules)
- IDE: VS Code or PyCharm

### Technical Expertise:
- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic understanding of UI/UX principles
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming
- Experience with Git & GitHub

## 3. UI/UX Design Strategy

### Approach:
- Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and consistency
- Use a component-based UI framework like **PyQt5** or **customTkinter**
- Responsive layout with keyboard navigation support
- Consistent color palette and typography
- Use icons and tooltips for better accessibility

### Tools:
- **Figma** for wireframing
- **Qt Designer** for UI prototyping (if using PyQt)
- **CustomTkinter** for modern UI look in Tkinter apps

### Accessibility:
- High contrast color scheme
- Keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation
- Scalable UI for different screen sizes

- **Performance Testing** – measuring response time and memory usage

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Ease of use (based on user feedback)
- Functionality completeness
- Bug frequency
- Performance benchmarks

## 6. Deployment Plan

### Packaging:
- Use **PyInstaller** or **cx_Freeze** to create `.exe` or `.dmg` files
- Platform support: Windows, macOS, Linux

### Distribution:
- GitHub Releases
- Documentation on GitHub Pages or ReadTheDocs

### Requirements File:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
